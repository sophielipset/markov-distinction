Tie-Dye Designer

Description: This system generates tie-dye patterns taking user inputs determining the dye colors, dye "pattern", and pattern background. 

Setup: 
1. Make sure the following are downloaded on your computer: 
    (a) Python 
    (b) Pip
    (c) PIL (Pillow)
2. Clone the repository and run the file main.py.
3. Follow the prompts in the terminal. The image should generate with the given user inputs.  

Questions: 
1. Describe how the system is personally meaningful to you.

    I wanted to design a system where the user could interact with the creativity of the system through their own creativity. I went to summer camp for many years as both a camper and a counselor, and tie-dye was a popular activity with seemingly endless combinations of dyes and patterns. This system gives me and other users a way to explore those patterns. 

2. Explain how working on it genuinely challenged you as a computer scientist. 

    Like most computer science projects, I felt challenged by the actual application of a theory we discussed in class. My challenges were also compounded by my rustiness working with Python and my unfamiliarity with working with images in Python. 

    I pushed myself to explore the boundaries between my creativity and computational creativity. My initial idea was to generate a fixed pattern with a fixed number of colors and a fixed background. Taking user inputs was an idea I had early on that I pushed myself to implement because it involved a function to generate a transition matrix. 

    This project was an important challenge to recognize and better understand computational creativity as an extension of how I can be creative. 

    As I go forward in this class, I want to keep asking how I can make a system more creative. 

6. Include a discussion of whether you believe your system is creative (and why or why not).

    I believe that my system is creative. It generates unique output for every input and also allows human input (therefore human creativity) in what is being generated.
